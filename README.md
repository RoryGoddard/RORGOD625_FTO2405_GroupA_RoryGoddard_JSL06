# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

In this coding challenge, I built a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal was to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click.

## Objectives:

- Create and use functions to dynamically populate the menu items on the page.
- Implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order.
- Use closures to maintain the state of the order.
- Utilize function expressions and anonymous functions.
- Call built-in functions and create custom functions to manage the menu and order system.

## Challenges Faced
This was a fun challenge and I enjoyed the problems we faced, once more I felt this reinforced what I had been working on with array methods, functions, closures, and I had tried to take a more functional approach with this project. 
I added my own object with the foods as keys and the prices as the values in order to try simulate having to grab the data from a database. I liked this approach instead of others. It was also a good exercise in fetching the names of the ordered foot items and then using those names to cross reference with the prices object to get each foods price. 

## Final Thoughts
Again, this was good practice in utilising what we had learnt about functions such as closures, arrow functions, as well as what we covered about array methods. I feel a lot more comfortable about all of these facets of Javascript going forward and I look forward to the next challenge.
